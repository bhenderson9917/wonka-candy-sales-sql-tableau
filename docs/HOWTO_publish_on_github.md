# How to Publish This Repo to GitHub (Quick Steps)

1) Create a new repo on GitHub (Public).
2) Do **not** initialize with a README (we already have one).
3) On your computer, run:

```bash
git init
git remote add origin <your-new-repo-url>
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: Wonka Candy Sales project"
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```
